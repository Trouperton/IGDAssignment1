The controls are keyboard only with following bindings:

Movement: W, A, S, D

Primary fire: Left Mouse Button

To play the game from the editor load the Test Level. At the very end of it you can find a gun to kill the enemy capsule.

For this project I have followed a tutorial on how to create a PSX style shader within Unreal Engine 4. 
The big thing I was experimenting with here was to emulate the tank controls and awkward camera angles of 
horror games of the period like Resident evil.
